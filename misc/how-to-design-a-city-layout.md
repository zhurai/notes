- greenery, cities

## fundamental
- not too chaotic/not too ordered (repetition)
- too much order is not great either
- variety and order

## visible life
- thing going on
- compared to dead streets
- highways/etc 

## compact
- lots of areas/plazas
- square (~30 meters in diameter)
    - containment but not claustrophobia

## orientation and mystery
- huge but also small backstreets and lanes
- mystery
- allyways
- small streets and big streets    some bulavards but some small streets
    - mystery and orientation

## scale
- nice things
- 5 stories high is ideal
- sometimes big building but must be great/best ambitions/needs/etc

## make it local
- use local material
- heights/width standardized quality of finish, etc
