= General Notes
- charting software: TC2000
- he used to be a normal day/bar chart trader, but after 2000 crash and playing around with indicators, found that patterns form the same way on all timeframes (1min to weekly charts)
= Chart Notes
- all timeframes form the same (base patterns, breakouts, price volume surges, channels, moving averages, ...) - any timeframe works
== Timeframe
- intraday: 1 min/5 min charts
= Stocks
- on the watch for stock that gaps up (**especially** premarket)
== "How do you find these stocks"
- pre market gappers (NASDAQ, premarket activity, market leaders/advancers/decliners)
- "if news is powerful, it usually results in a gap and followthrough"
== Patterns he looks for

= Process
1. Puts the stocks premarket on his list2
2. lots at the stocks immediately after market opens
3. puts them on the list "leading % gainers on NASDAQ/etc"
4. the ones that are spurting in volume stand out (sideways for awhile then spike) "price volume surges"
5. **Without volume, price surges are mea2ningless
