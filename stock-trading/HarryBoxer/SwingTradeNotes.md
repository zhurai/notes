= Chart Timeframes
- Look at the daily and 15 minute charts to identify breakouts
- Check the hourly chart to see patterns developing
- Check 15 minute for a closer look

= Mindset
- "don't be upset if you sold the stock at a profit...like if the stock went up more... (e.g. someone sold apple at a profit but apple went up further)"
- "worst thing to do is dwell on over a profit you could have made that could have been a bigger profit"
- as long as the money is moving and is in something else, that should be the key

= Orders and Timeframes
- finite timing: looks at 5 min chart (during a session when he's about to make a swing trade) 
- time it by looking at 5 and 15 min charts

= Important Points about Volume
- **VOLUME IS ALWAYS THE KEY**
- Not entirely about liquidity of the stock (some liquidity is good but not the main)
- If the stock is moving (spike up very strongly) and it's trading at 40-50k shares then it's very dangerous
    - Could have been manipulated by 1-2 institutional traders

= Setting Stops
- instead of doing on intraday basis, you do it on a daily basis, you use a 15min chart basis
- don't be in the stock/stay in the stock if it looks dangerous
- When to Exit:
    - Top of the channel
    - Prior overhead resistance
- Resistance becomes support when violated (and then support becomes resistance)
- You HAVE to have a stop (a mental one or an actual order)
- If stopped out, that's the way it goes 
- **"Ask yourself: if you are disciplined enough to actually press the sell button when the stock breaks its support level, when I know it should be sold"  "The answer is if it's not in your brokerage acct, you'll probably not do it... or you'll hesitate and it'll cost you more money"**

= Charting/Service Specific notes
- 5-15min charts, continue to draw lines and trends and keep changing it (looking/updating/etc)
- top 25 list which he updates on weekends only, so out of date by this talk (refers to it for swing trading) 
    - these are the top 25 stocks in wall street
- Generally stops are up to you
- Basically, he uses the stocks in his "universe" to find daytrading/short term trading stock opportunities
- For Swing Trading specificallyi, he looks for patterns on 15 min/daily icharts (daily -> 15 min for timing -> 5 min for entry/exit points -> sometimes 1 min)
- VOLUME
