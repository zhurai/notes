= General Notes
- charting software: TC2000
- he used to be a normal day/bar chart trader, but after 2000 crash and playing around with indicators, found that patterns form the same way on all timeframes (1min to weekly charts)
= Chart Notes
- all timeframes form the same (base patterns, breakouts, price volume surges, channels, moving averages, ...) - any timeframe works
== Timeframe
- intraday: 1 min/5 min charts
= Stocks
- on the watch for stock that gaps up (**especially** premarket)
- when looking for stocks he looks at the **biggest percent gainers** on his list
- does NOT like stocks that trade thinly, does not care how much it goes up **needs volume**
- acquisitions/takeovers: stock gaps up and then goes sideways (no reason for it to go higher)
=== "How do you find these stocks"
- pre market gappers (NASDAQ, premarket activity, market leaders/advancers/decliners)
- "if news is powerful, it usually results in a gap and followthrough"
=== Process
- Gets a list of 10-15 stocks (maybe more, as many as possible) early on before/at market open
- Culls the list throughout the day
  - "something people don't do is update their patterns throughout the day"   
- another important thing is to **get back in** after selling it
  - **Some of the people in his room go in and out of a stock 5-6 times in one day**
  - othersjust stays in it (e.g. if it's performing well.  Don't leave it for too long)
- He usually says 2 targets (based on resistance and measured move)
== Patterns he looks for
- quick pullback/quick consolidation (sharply) usually leads to more upside
  - buy after the first pullback
  - his stop out generally if it passes through a previous support (a previous high)
  - Basically breakouts or break downs
= Process
1. Puts the stocks premarket on his list2
2. lots at the stocks immediately after market opens
3. puts them on the list "leading % gainers on NASDAQ/etc"
4. the ones that are spurting in volume stand out (sideways for awhile then spike) "price volume surges"
5. **Without volume, price surges are meaningless**

= Watch List
- Sorted by % change
- Also sorted by volume

= Protection from Losses
- Put the stop where the opening gap up started
  - "I think the opening gap is CRITICAL"
  - if a stock is going to gap up, consolidate and higher that's one thing
  - but if a stock gaps up comes down to support, barely bounces, and goes around there, then breaks, then it's bad
  - above the morning high is also another good stopping point
- In Day Trading, do **not** anticipate until you actually see an actual reversal and break of the trendline
  - e.g. you **think** it has hit the low, and hasn't reversed yet
  - for example it should break the trend line (again: **With Volume**)
    - (may need to retest, but as long as it's not broken that's fine?)
- If it hits the target, can sell it, stay with it, or **sell half of your position**

= Categories of trades
- Scalp = must be 2-4% gains
  - 5 to 15 minute trades
- Day Trade must be 5%+ gains in the stock
  - you don't want to go in and out many times in a stock but the actual gain per trade (if any) is low

= Personal Questions
- How to tell when the bounce is done
