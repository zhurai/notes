    - Azure - learn core concepts&services (get certification)
    - Dev Tools - become a power user (VS Code, CLI, CL/CD)
- Build local prototypes
    - Use Frameworks - learn application frameworks for you language
    - Quickstart - build with starter templates, explore open-source
    - Development Environment - Install and use the right tools for e2e workflows
- Deploy to cloud and scale
    - Azure Static Web Apps - build and deploy directly from the codebase
    - Azure Functions - event driven serverless API and architecture
    - Azure CosmosDB - multi model globally distributed NoSQL db
- Simplify your development experience and Automate

Keynote: Ten Commandments of Navigating Code Reviews (Angie Jones)
======
## Notes
- Twitter: https://twitter.com/techgirl1908
- 10 commandments for navigating code reviews
    - Thou shalt not take it personally - some people are just jerks, some people lack the social skills to write a nice message, some are brutally honest, some people have bias, etc.  Fighting each of these individually will probably not be useful. 
    - Thou shalt not marry the code - don't become attached (married) to the code, you can look like you are emotional/defensive
    - Thou shalt consider all feedback - once detached, it becomes easier to hear what the reviewer said
    - Thou shalt articulate your rationale - you don't need to automatically assume the person right, they may be just throwing ideas out there. Consider their suggestion, but articulate why (and post this in the actual post review publically)
    - Thou shalt be willing to compromise - don't get into a heated back and forth exchange, offer to collaborate in person (e.g. whiteboarding)
    - Thou shalt contribute to others' code reviews - if you're always the submitter and not just the reviewer, you look like a junior developer (also allows you to look at other's code and become a stronger programmer)
    - Thou shalt treat submitters how thou wants to be treated - don't need to be a jerk/be petty when they do it (be the bigger person)
    - Thou shalt not be intimidated by the number of comments - e.g. when learning a new language
    - Thou shalt not repeat the same mistakes
    - Thou shalt embrace the nit (nitpickers)

Design Systems for Developers (Kathryn Grayson Nanz)
======
Developer Advocate for KendoReact at Progress
## Notes
- Twitter: https://twitter.com/kathryngrayson
- Design systems are for developers too! - improve your understands of how designs/prototypes translate to code
- What is a design system - collection of interconnected visual elements, organized and documented for easy reference
- What is the purpose - Provide visual/language consistency
- Visual consistency between pages/devices - helps when there's multiple developers working on different pages
- Language consistency - everyone speaking the same words to describe the same thing/standardize
- Design tokens - smallest parts of design system - usually correspond directly to css (e.g. border-radius-regular), use these as variables, brand colors/fonts
- Icon Libraries - choesive set of icons
- Component Libraries - collection of all components used in the app and documentation (developer/designer communication)
- Grid Systems - guidelines and structure for page layouts (idea of using a grid to fit information is very old in the design space) (usually UI based). Useful for visual consistency
- Style Guides - downloadable brand assets and documentation (brand colors/fonts), logos/variations, brand specific characters/icons and instructions for their use (consistent look and feel)
- Tone of voice guide - capturing a feeling/tone is hard, but how you do it is very important to the users (small things like buttons/etc can matter a lot) e.g. let's go vs start
