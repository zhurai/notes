= Keynote: Fireside Chat (Kelsey Hightower)
(Kelsy Hightower: Principle Engineer at Google)
- He got interested in Retail/Food Service and took classes in college but decided not to go, but wanted a good career
- Instead got A+ Certification
- That exam opened up and break into the tech world (IT) (1999-2000) 
- Accessibility was a big issue back then (job description saying 10+ YOE)*
- Contract Jobs to start (DSL install), opened up his own Computer store as he didn't feel qualified to interview for those jobs
- Some antedoctes of how IT/tech helped him get into doors that he wouldn't be able to before 
- "Opportunities are typically not given, they're taken"
- Doubled down on learning new tech skills
- T-shaped engineer - go deep into the fundamentals and become well rounded engineer (makes it easier to pick up new technologies)
- If you were starting today: Find a community in tech (programming language, specific type of programming like frontend, go to meetups, present at meetups, get feedback from community, ask questions/process answers) 
    - tech twitter, meetups, bootcamps, etc, go all in
    - basically he would network himself a LOT
- (Simon Wardly) Stategist that made a technique called "Wardley Map" - Look at your situation like a landscape, positioning, movement, etc
    - applied in a competitive way can be useful in businesses
    - can also be applied to one's own career (essentially competing with yourself)
- Wardley Map applied to career: Look at 3 things
    - 1. What technology does the world run on right now (e.g. SQL is a stable technology)
    - 2. contribute to 1-2 open source projects that interest you (and learn it in public) - Especially technologies that you want to see come into the world (he typically)
    - 3. Become an expert in whatever technology you are doing for your job
- "It's easy to predict the future when you're working on it"
- How he learns:
    - Copy and paste the code
    - Learn what it means
    - Watch videos/read about the language
    - Once it makes sense, tries his own code
- "Stay consistent and stay diligent"
- "Do enough to make me respect me tomorrow" - you can't solve all the world's problems, but stay focused on what you can fix
    - "There is no perfect company"
    - But be aware of what the criticisms are, so you can have empathy for others
    - "You are not your job" "technology doesn't replace humans" 
- Figure out how you can put your own personality on top of the work, you stand out as an individual, and that is how you get noticed 
- "Enjoy every minute of this"
