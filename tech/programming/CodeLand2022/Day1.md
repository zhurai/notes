= Keynote: Fireside Chat (Kelsey Hightower)
(Kelsy Hightower: Principle Engineer at Google)
- He got interested in Retail/Food Service and took classes in college but decided not to go, but wanted a good career
- Instead got A+ Certification
- That exam opened up and break into the tech world (IT) (1999-2000) 
- Accessibility was a big issue back then (job description saying 10+ YOE)*
- Contract Jobs to start (DSL install), opened up his own Computer store as he didn't feel qualified to interview for those jobs
- Some antedoctes of how IT/tech helped him get into doors that he wouldn't be able to before 
- "Opportunities are typically not given, they're taken"
- Doubled down on learning new tech skills
- T-shaped engineer - go deep into the fundamentals and become well rounded engineer (makes it easier to pick up new technologies)
- If you were starting today: Find a community in tech (programming language, specific type of programming like frontend, go to meetups, present at meetups, get feedback from community, ask questions/process answers) 
    - tech twitter, meetups, bootcamps, etc, go all in
    - basically he would network himself a LOT
- (Simon Wardly) Stategist that made a technique called "Wardley Map" - Look at your situation like a landscape, positioning, movement, etc
    - applied in a competitive way can be useful in businesses
    - can also be applied to one's own career (essentially competing with yourself)
- Wardley Map applied to career: Look at 3 things
    - 1. What technology does the world run on right now (e.g. SQL is a stable technology)
    - 2. contribute to 1-2 open source projects that interest you (and learn it in public) - Especially technologies that you want to see come into the world (he typically)
    - 3. Become an expert in whatever technology you are doing for your job
- "It's easy to predict the future when you're working on it"
- How he learns:
    - Copy and paste the code
    - Learn what it means
    - Watch videos/read about the language
    - Once it makes sense, tries his own code
- "Stay consistent and stay diligent"
- "Do enough to make me respect me tomorrow" - you can't solve all the world's problems, but stay focused on what you can fix
    - "There is no perfect company"
    - But be aware of what the criticisms are, so you can have empathy for others
    - "You are not your job" "technology doesn't replace humans" 
- Figure out how you can put your own personality on top of the work, you stand out as an individual, and that is how you get noticed 
- "Enjoy every minute of this"

= Redefining Your Programming Purpose (Tracy P Holmes)
(Developer Advocate)
- "Slowly is the fastest way to get where you want to be" - Andre De Shields
- Went from coding (C++/.NET) to IT (Sysadmin) back to coding (specifically python)
- Don't know how to ask for help but didn't know enough to know what she didn't know
- "If what you want doesn’t exist, create it"
- She has very good quotes

= Celibrate You're Misteaks (Joe Glombek)
- TDODAR decision making model
    - Time - How much time do we have
    - Diagnosis - What is the problem
    - Options - List all of the possible solutions
    - Decide - take charge and make a decision
    - Assign - assign tasks to people
    - Review - has the problem been resolved? should we be doing something else?
    - Did we make any mistakes?
- How does this apply to development
    - Everyone makes mistakes on a regular basis
    - Create a culture of sharings (sharing our mistakes)
    - Helps to learn about others' mistakes (saves us from making the same mistake)
- Good time to share mistakes, and how to share mistakes
    - Project washups/retrospectives
    - One-to-one's talking about progress - "Mistakes are progress as well"
    - Git commit history
    - Code in public (including open source projects)
    
= Next-Gen Inclusivity: How Gen Z Can Make Real Change in Tech (Haimantika Mitra)

= Teaching Through Code Review (Derek Binkley)
- too often it is a cursory process or contentious process
- how to get a learning/collaborative process out of this
- purpose of code review is to prevent bugs and ensure consistency
- Better off to automate tedious checks (reduces friction and increases consistency)
- Making time for code review (add code review to estimates)
- Might be better for everyone to code review
    - allows everyone to get involved and ask questions
    - asking questions makes it a learning process
- Recommendation to have pull requests smaller instead of huge
- Readable vs Unreadable code
- having negative feedback (Just saying no/treating it like grading a paper) does not help
- Commenting with kindness (you are building something together), phrasing it as a question can help
- Accidental code review / incidental pair programming can be helpful
- "Development is a collaborative task, done between humans, please treat others with humility, kindness and be nice to others, even if there are problems "in production stages""
- Ask for help if needed (hopefully there is an environment where collaboration is encouraged)

= The Shared Responsibility of Tech Ethics (Erin Mikail Staples)
- "Working in tech doesn't mean that our personal values cease to exist"
- Pop culture perpetrated tropes that ethics is an idealistic myth rather than reality
- Current problems
    - Reliance on tools not people
    - desire to connect without why
    - lack of transparency
    - taught to stick to the status quo
    - culture of community or hype/missing out?
- Embracing the power of the individual
    - individuals make up communities
    - communities are all around us
    - how can communities must protect the individual to thrive (to be who they are)
- Should
    - Celebrate individual beliefs
    - honor strong individual ethics
    - embracing "see something say something"
    - foster a culture of contribution/conversation
- share where you're coming from (your history, personal ethics)
    - "Transparency is the new objectivity"
    - What do you stand for
    - What don't you tolerate
    - How do you communicate (emoji/pronouns/etc)
    - What are your pet peeves?
    - What makes you feel valued?
- Know and identify your own personal code of ethics toi know where you stand and what will leave you fulfilled
- Individual outcomes
    - know if needs are met
    - build a track record of trust
    - raise awareness of tough issues
    - contribute to culture creation
    - pave the way for someone new
    - help the community around you

= A Programmer's Guide to Mental Health (Raymond Chung)
- "It's okay to be not okay"
- Imposter Syndrome - first job, didn't want to be exposed as a fraud, was too hard on himself which created bad habits
- you will experience Imposter Syndrome (on and off) during your career (it's how you know you're growing)
- Good tactics to mitigate the negative effects of Imposter syndrome
    - Keep a win list
    - Give yourself positive affirmations
    - Set talking points with your lead/interns for 1 on 1's (What do you want to talk about in the 1:1, What are the next steps? What do you want to pair on today?)
- Signs of burnout
    - Feeling stressed 
    - Feeling like you failed
    - Dissatisfied with the work you are doing
    - Lacking self care (Define core working hours especially when remote)
    - Organize your day with a set agenda
    - Get 1% better each day (focus on the process rather than the end goal, create a consistent habit via a routine)
    - Keep a social chat going!

= How I Tracked My Pregnancy with Python & Emojis (Hannah Hazi)

= I Think, Therefore I Code: An Introduction to Pseudocode (Silvia España)
- Main job for programmers is to solve problems
- develop algorithms to allow us to provide solutions
- Basically technical recipies
- algorithms must be
    - precise (indicate exactly what we want to do)
    - organized (specify the sequence in which the steps should occur)
    - finites (beginning and the end - the solution)
    - specific (solve a concrete/defined solution/problem)
    - defined (results always the same)
- Pseudocode depending on implementation of pseudocode
    - helps provide a structure
    - show the beginning and the end
    - simplified/make it easy to understand
- makes it easier to translate to the target language
