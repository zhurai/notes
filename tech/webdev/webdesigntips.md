## CSS Tips
- max-width on text - hard to read when it's very long horizontally
    - (wrap in a container and put a max width and margin)
    - 45 to 75 characters in a line
    - e.g. 60 root em or character length
- let the design breathe
    - add padding or not full (100%) width
    - text on the very side of the screen is very awkward to read
    - putting a gap between columns is good too
    - margin/padding on background images
    - space paragraph text (e.g. line-height to 1.5 or so)
- contrast with color
    - be careful with readability
    - chrome inspecter helps with determining this (contrast)
    - differences in color between background and the text
    - differences in color between paragraph text and heading text
- avoid justifying text
    - weird/awkward when displaying in smaller screens
    - if using justifying text, you generally need hyphenation (javascript libraries)
    - can use text-align center but use it sparingly
    - difficult to read text-align centered paragraph text 
    - better to use text-align centered text with short text
- contrast with font sizes
    - font-weight can help (Bolding)
    - font-size can help grab your eye a bit better for headings (especially with lower line heights)
    - font-size can have issues in smaller screen sizes (ratio between types should be lower)
