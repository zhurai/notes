## Recommendations
### Units
- **Gabriel** w/ Offtank Striker: Tank (Gabriel is a Tower + Anti Siege RES)
- **Shiyoon** to counter: 36-50% CDR **(keep him out of silence range)**
  - Prydwen says 36%, but from other research, I have seen 50% considered the minimum
- Harim: can reduce CDR needed for Shiyoon
- Arius: barriers can help survive
- Standard Damage Dealers (Sobin, A. Rifle, Ifrit, Xiao, A.Seo Yoon)
- Standard Defense Shred (Tarrasque, Seo Yoon, Chifuyu, Terminator, Lone Lee)
- Standard Buffers (Shin Ja, A. ShinJa, Seo Yoon, Yang Harim) + Hayami Sanae (Anti Siege Damage Buffs)
### Gameplay
- Deploy unit far away from others to handle the skills
- Shiyoon counter Phase 2 while Phase 3 starts: Backstep gets cancelled
- DPS prefers Crit Damage + Anti Ground
- Try to keep DPS within Sanae's buff aura
