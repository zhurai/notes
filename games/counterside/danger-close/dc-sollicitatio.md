# Danger Close - Sollicitatio
## Type = Siege
## Phase Notes
### Passive (All Phases)
- Skill: removes all debuffs
- Aura: Damage Taken +25%, Skill Seal
### HP 75%+ (Phase 1)
- walks toward ship, stops at Tower units
- Skill: 2 bombs (one nearest, one furthest) **counterable**
### HP 33%-66% (Phase 2)
- jumps back, resets skill cooldown to full 
- resumes previous behavior (walks towards ship, stops at Tower units)
- Skill: vaccums backline (5th vaccum causes an explosion) **counterable**
### HP 33%- (Phase 3)
- jumps back, resets skill cooldown to full 
- resumes previous behavior (walks towards ship, stops at Tower units)
- Skill: 2 regular bombs (one nearest, one furthest) + 1 vaccum bomb (backline)
- Note: better to burst through this phase
### Timer 1:03 (Bored Phase)
- ignores current HP% Phase, and goes straight for the ship (ignores Towers)
- Skill: carpet bombs the area
- Ultimate: when reaches ship (instantly destroys it)
## Recommendations
### Units
- **Gabriel** w/ Offtank Striker: Tank (Gabriel is a Tower + Anti Siege RES)
- **Shiyoon** to counter: 36-50% CDR **(keep him out of silence range)**
  - Prydwen says 36%, but from other research, I have seen 50% considered the minimum
- Harim: can reduce CDR needed for Shiyoon
- Arius: barriers can help survive
- Standard Damage Dealers (Sobin, A. Rifle, Ifrit, Xiao, A.Seo Yoon)
- Standard Defense Shred (Tarrasque, Seo Yoon, Chifuyu, Terminator, Lone Lee)
- Standard Buffers (Shin Ja, A. ShinJa, Seo Yoon, Yang Harim) + Hayami Sanae (Anti Siege Damage Buffs)
### Gameplay
- Deploy unit far away from others to handle the skills
- Shiyoon counter Phase 2 while Phase 3 starts: Backstep gets cancelled
- DPS prefers Crit Damage + Anti Ground
- Try to keep DPS within Sanae's buff aura
