# Danger Close - Nervier
## Type = Ranger
## Phase Notes
- Phases are based on HP Bar
### Phase 1 (HP Bar 1)
- Summons mobs
  - **Pay attention to the Sniper mob**
- Special: ???
- Near end of phase action
  - pushes all ground units back to ship
  - reduces hit%
  - does NOT reduce movement speed
### Phase 2 (HP Bar 2)
- (re)Summons mobs (Sniper mob)
  - Question: Including others?
- Summons 3 points on the map that do a DOT (damage over time)
### Phase 3 (HP Bar 3)
- Casts a field wide poison to the area
## Timeline Notes
- N/A
## Recommendations
### Units
- Rosaria -> Other Rangers (Gaeun/etc)
  - Rosaria is most ideal because she is an air unit + doesn't get damaged + does high damage herself
- Edel -> can be useful here? (extra bodies to help frontline survive)
- Regina -> ice shields + doesn't have role disadvantage vs sniper  (or bring a ranger DPS)
- Harim -> supporter with skill haste
- Chifuyu
- Ranged Buffers (Seo yoon, Shin Ja, etc)
### Gameplay
- DPS + Gear check
