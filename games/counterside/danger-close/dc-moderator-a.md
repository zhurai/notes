# Danger Close - Moderator A
## Type = Defender
## Phase Notes
### Phase 1
- if nothing in melee: 8s timer (melee check)
  - expire: fire laser, start phase 2
- Special: remove debuffs, does scan 
  - if 3+ units: places 2 landmines at furthest unit
  - else: places 2 landmines next to ship 
  - Landmines: cause damage and create fog (debuff HIT)
- **2:18**: DPS Check 
  - fail: fire laser -> phase 2
  - success: stunned -> phase 2
- HP under 33%: immediately remove debuffs, fire laser, start phase 2
### Phase 2
- walk from spawn to middle
- does not melee check, does not use skills
- HP under 33%: finishes walking, **Then** fires laser
- Prydwen considers this Phase 1.5
### Phase 3

  - expire: fire laser, start phase 2
- **1:53**: Boss ultimate (missile barrage, knock units forward, high damage)
- **1:33**: DPS Check
  - fail: fire laser -> phase 4
  - success: stunned -> phase 4
- Prydwen considers this Phase 2
### Phase 4

- does not melee check, does not use skills
- Prydwen considers this Phase 2.5
### Phase 5
- does a DPS check
  - fail: fire laser
  - success: stunned
- attacks the ship ignoring others
- Prydwen considers this Phase 3
## Timeline Notes
- (Assuming no debuffs, without bursting to 33%, etc)
- **2:50**: Phase 1 Special (scan into bombs)
- **2:38**: deploying gaeun here (assuming melee died at 2:32) = pseudo proximity check until 2:26 **(arrives at 2:31 and cancels check until 2:26)**
- **2:24-26**: if a melee dies/retreats, then melee check will occur (avoid bombs, avoid fog) (DPS Check cancels proximity check)
- **2:24-2:23**: New Detroit S2 here (12 seconds -50% DEF)
- **2:23**: Phase 1 Special (scan into bombs) 
- **2:18**: Enable ultimates?
- **2:18**: DPS Check appears
- **2:12**: DPS Check ends
- **1:53**: Boss ultimate (missile barrage, knock units forward, high damage)
- **1:33**: DPS Check
## Recommendations
### Units
- Tanks: Chifuyu/Roy, Lin Xien (with specialized min max compositions), Defenders (if cannot survive)
  - Rearm Esterosa?, A. Joo Shiyoon?
- Pseudo Melee (for melee check): Shin Ja, Kyle, Gaeun, Tarrasque
- Damage Dealers: Kim Sobin, A. Rifleman, Ifrit, Rosaria, (A.Seo Yoon)
- Defense Shred: Tarrasque, Seo Yoon, Roy, Chifuyu, Lucrecia 
- Buffers: Shin Ja, A. Shin Ja, Seo Yoon, Dorothy, Sky, Harim
### Gameplay
- stack defense shred for DPS Checks (2:18 or 1:33)
- can avoid bombs by delaying deployment
- can iframe knockback/damage from ultimate at 1:55
- evade attacks vs boss: 801+ evasion
- sure fire vs boss: 1875+ hit w/ 50% evasion debuff    
- Prydwen mentions by leaving boss on proximity check at 2:26, the boss would not use skills during it, and DPS check at 2:18 will cancel proximity check
